## Background

CCVARN was created due to a personal need of having the ability to automatically version and create release notes when commits following [conventional-commits][] were being used.

## Install

CCVARN can be installed by using the .NET Core toolset by running the following:

```console
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ccvarn
```

## Usage

The most basic form of using CCVARN in to run

```console
dotnet ccvarn parse
```

This will assert the version and extract any commits that follow conventional commit.
The results is by default written to a `JSON` file called `CCVARN.json` (can be overridden by passing in a different file path).

Additionally if you want to have release notes exported as plain text or markdown, you can additionally run:

```console
dotnet ccvarn --output ReleaseNotes.txt --output ReleaseNotes.md
```

The type of the output is determined based on the file extension specified (currently supported are `.txt` and `.md` for release notes, and `.json` for exporting all information).
